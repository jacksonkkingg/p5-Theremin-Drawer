# p5-Theremin-Drawer

hey guys

to use this, basically just move your hands around and figure it out!!

some basic controls:

pinch fingers with respective color attached to draw in that respective color, pinch left pointer finger to manually erase drawing, and pinch left pinky to thumb to erase everything!

thanks and enjoy ðŸ˜œ
